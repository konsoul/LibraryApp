# LibraryApp

First : Download/Clone your fork using git@github.com:konsoul/LibraryApp.git

1. Edit file on local machine.
2. Go into GitKraken and commit file.
3. Push file so that it exists on the 'tony' fork on GitHub.
4. Right click on the 'master' branch and select "Start a pull request to origin from origin/tony.
5. A dialog box will appear asking you what branch you want to merge with what branch. You want to merge origin/tony with origin/master.
6. Make pull request. 
7. Go online to GitHub and see where it says "pull requests", click that and you will see a breakdown of your changes that you commited to your branch. 
8. There is an option to merge with 'master'. 

NOTE: You do not have to merge with master, in fact you can go back and make more changes and then push those to GitHub and those changes will show up in the pull request. Once all is well, we can then choose 'merge', and that will merge the changes from your fork to the master file. 

We can also merge changes from my fork to yours if needs be. 

I'm going to edit this. This is my edit.
